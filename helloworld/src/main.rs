/*
This is new in a minor way. I'm used to C++ and Java where there is a lot of stuff preceding the print statement.
Rust calls this a Macros which I've heard talked about in C but have never used. Which I guess doesn't matter since
the docs say Rust's are different from C's.

My very limited experience with make makes Cargo seem like a dream
